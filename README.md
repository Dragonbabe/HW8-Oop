## General Info

I could not make the whole process work. I had certain pieces working and then just broke it all so I put it back to the point where it was working. Perhaps I was just thinking that it was more similar to the last homework and it was not. My brain is broken at this point and I know there are a lot of functions in there that did not get called an I suppose I just am barely understanding Javascript is the bottom line and I get lost in the code.

## Technologies

Project is created with :

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Summary

I suppose I am giving up. I tried really hard to get it done but the truth of the matter is I just didn't have enough time to it and I don't understand the concepts enough to get my code working and I am completely devastated about it. There just isn't enough help and people can't explain in a way I understand and it takes me forever to grasp it.
